# WebForSecurityImprovements
This solution is for students to improve in terms of security - after testing, e.g. SQL injection.
Follow the provided Word Document.

Import the database (smonitor.sql) into DB named smonitor using PhpMyAdmin

The solution was tested using USB web server at port 8090 with MySQL 3308. 

If you do not wish to change the webserver settings, change the values in both: the database scripts and the controller scripts.
An improvement would be for there to be a configuration script - another version.
